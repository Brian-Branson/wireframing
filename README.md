A startup building a healthcare booking app used wireframes to test the user flow early on. Users found the calendar confusing, the booking process too long, and feedback unclear. The team simplified the calendar, reduced steps, and added a confirmation screenâ€”all within the wireframes. These changes improved usability, cut bounce rates by 30%, and earned positive user feedback. This showed how wireframing helps catch issues early, saving time and ensuring a user-friendly design.
